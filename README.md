# BFS-on-Word-Representable-Graphs
Investing the computational complexity of Breadth-First Search (BFS) on Word Representable Graphs, specifically exploring whether the BFS problem in this context is NP-complete. The project involves theoretical analysis and algorithmic design to assess the complexity class of BFS within these specialized graph structures.
