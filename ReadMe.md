# BFS-on-Word-Representable-Graphs
# Definition
 A simple graph G = (V, E) is word-representable if there exists a word w over the alphabet A(w) = V such that letters x and y alternate in w if and only if xy âˆˆ E, that is, x and y are 
 connected by an edge, for each x = y. We say that w represents G, and w is called a word-representant for G.

# Tasks
-Analyzing the computational complexity of Breadth-First Search (BFS) on Word Representable Graphs, specifically exploring whether the BFS problem in this context is NP-complete. 

-The project involves theoretical analysis and algorithmic design to assess the complexity class of BFS within these specialized graph structures.
